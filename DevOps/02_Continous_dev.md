## Continous Development

### What is CD?

Continous Development (CD) is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of delivering software changes to users. It builds upon the principles of Continous Integration (CI) by automating the deployment of code to production environments.

### Benefits of CD

* **Faster delivery of software:** CD helps to deliver software changes to users more quickly, reducing the time it takes to get new features and bug fixes into production.
* **Improved quality:** CD helps to improve the quality of software by automating the deployment process and ensuring that code changes are tested thoroughly before they are released.
* **Reduced risk:** CD helps to reduce the risk of deploying faulty code by automating the deployment process and ensuring that code changes are tested thoroughly before they are released.
* **Increased efficiency:** CD helps to increase efficiency by automating the deployment process and reducing the amount of manual work required.

### CD Workflow

A typical CD workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Code changes are committed to the shared repository.**
2. **The CI server automatically builds and tests the code.**
3. **If the build and tests pass, the code is deployed to a staging environment.**
4. **The code is tested in the staging environment.**
5. **If the tests pass in the staging environment, the code is deployed to the production environment.**

### CD Tools

There are many CD tools available, including:

* **Jenkins:** A popular open-source CI/CD server.
* **Travis CI:** A cloud-based CI/CD service.
* **CircleCI:** Another cloud-based CI/CD service.
* **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD service built into GitHub.
* **Azure DevOps:** A CI/CD service from Microsoft.

### Best Practices for CD

* **Automate everything:** Automate as many tasks as possible, including building, testing, and deploying code.
* **Use a shared repository:** Use a shared repository to store all code changes.
* **Integrate frequently:** Integrate code changes frequently, ideally several times a day.
* **Test thoroughly:** Test code thoroughly to ensure that it is working correctly.
* **Use a CD server:** Use a CD server to automate the deployment process.
* **Monitor the CD process:** Monitor the CD process to identify any problems.

### Conclusion

CD is an essential practice for
 modern software development. It helps to deliver software changes to users more
